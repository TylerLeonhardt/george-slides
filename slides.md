# The Beginning — Saturday

<v-clicks>

- 🕐 Saturday afternoon: sat down at my machine
- 🚀 Used **Copilot CLI autopilot mode** to scaffold the first version
- 🎯 Goal: a Copilot-powered bot I could talk to over Telegram
- ✅ Got Telegram working + live restart (`/restart` rebuilds and redeploys)
- 🚶 **Then I walked away from my computer.**

# Building Via Chat

Everything after Saturday was built **entirely through Telegram**

<v-clicks>

- 💬 I'd message George: *"fix this bug"*, *"add this feature"*, *"review that PR"*
- 🤖 George delegates to specialist agents — coder, reviewer, researcher, bug-fixer, feature-builder
- 🔀 They create branches, write code, run tests, open PRs, and merge
- 🖥️ **I haven't touched my IDE since Saturday**

# What George Actually Is

George isn't a chatbot — he's a **CTO with an engineering team**

<v-clicks>

- **George** = CTO <span class="text-gray-400">(orchestration, delegation, culture)</span>
- **Agents** = Engineering team <span class="text-gray-400">(Copilot CLI instances with project skills)</span>
- **You** = CEO <span class="text-gray-400">(vision, direction, final calls)</span>

# The Dashboard

Real-time visibility into what the team is doing

<v-clicks>

# What We've Already Unlocked

<v-clicks>

- ✅ **Vibes → engineering** — *"the Office view called me CEO"* → George dispatched agents to fix it
- ✅ **Greenfield from chat** — *"make me slides"* → George created this repo, scaffolded Slidev, built it, pushed it
- ✅ **Visual feedback** — Playwright screenshots & video → sent directly to Telegram
- ✅ **Self-managing teams** — agents review each other's PRs, check CI, merge when green

<div class="pt-6 text-xl text-gray-400">
What's next: proactive George (notices problems before you do), deploy from chat, full project lifecycle from conversation
